 <h1> Why Include SAT Scores in This Program? </h1>
 <div class="image-txt-container">
    <p>Although SAT scores are slowly being deprioritized in the college admissions process, they have and still are a baseline assessment of a student’s chance of getting into a certain school. Of course there are various factors to be considered in a college application like extracurriculars and grades but those would be a lot more difficult to assimilate into a python program because extracurriculars vary and colleges may only look at grades from certain classes depending on the major a student is applying for. SAT scores are a simple and effective means to narrow down the college options as colleges generally have a SAT range their student’s scores fall into.</p>
